]Here are **50 beginner-level ReactJS interview questions** along with answers, covering the fundamental concepts that help assess a candidate's knowledge of React:

---

### 1. **What is React?**
   - **Answer**: React is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It enables the development of reusable UI components and manages the state efficiently using a virtual DOM.

### 2. **What are components in React?**
   - **Answer**: Components are the building blocks of a React application. They can be either **functional** (stateless) or **class-based** (stateful) and manage rendering logic, state, and user interactions.

### 3. **What is JSX?**
   - **Answer**: JSX (JavaScript XML) is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML. It allows you to write HTML elements in JavaScript code, which React will convert into JavaScript objects (React elements).

### 4. **What is the difference between state and props?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **State**: Represents data that is managed within a component and can change over time.
     - **Props**: Short for "properties," these are values passed to a component by its parent and are read-only within the child component.

### 5. **What is the Virtual DOM in React?**
   - **Answer**: The Virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of the actual DOM. React updates the Virtual DOM first, compares it with the real DOM, and then updates only the parts of the UI that need to change, improving performance.

### 6. **What is the difference between a class component and a functional component?**
   - **Answer**:
     - **Class components**: ES6 classes that manage state and lifecycle methods.
     - **Functional components**: Simpler components that are stateless and don’t have lifecycle methods (unless using hooks).

### 7. **What are React Hooks?**
   - **Answer**: React Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and lifecycle features in functional components. Common hooks include `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext`.

### 8. **What is `useState` and how does it work?**
   - **Answer**: `useState` is a React hook that allows you to add state to functional components. It returns an array with the current state and a function to update the state.
     ```javascript
     const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
     ```

### 9. **What is `useEffect`?**
   - **Answer**: `useEffect` is a hook that runs side effects in functional components, such as data fetching or DOM manipulation. It runs after every render by default, but you can control when it runs by specifying dependencies.

### 10. **What is the Context API in React?**
   - **Answer**: The Context API allows you to share data across multiple components without prop drilling. It’s useful for passing down global data like authentication status, themes, or language preferences.

### 11. **What is the purpose of `React.Fragment`?**
   - **Answer**: `React.Fragment` allows you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. It’s useful when returning multiple elements from a component without wrapping them in an additional `div`.

### 12. **What is `useMemo`?**
   - **Answer**: `useMemo` is a hook that memoizes a value so that it only recomputes when its dependencies change. It helps optimize performance by avoiding expensive calculations on every render.

### 13. **What is `useCallback`?**
   - **Answer**: `useCallback` is a hook that memoizes a function to ensure that it doesn’t get recreated on every render. It’s useful when passing functions as props to child components to avoid unnecessary re-renders.

### 14. **What is the difference between `componentDidMount` and `useEffect`?**
   - **Answer**: `componentDidMount` is a lifecycle method in class components, while `useEffect` is a hook for functional components. Both are used to run code after the component is mounted, but `useEffect` is more flexible and can handle cleanup.

### 15. **What are controlled components?**
   - **Answer**: Controlled components are form elements (like `input`) whose values are controlled by React state. The value is set using state, and any changes to the input are handled by updating the state.

### 16. **What are uncontrolled components?**
   - **Answer**: Uncontrolled components are form elements that manage their own state. They do not rely on React’s state; instead, their current values are accessed using the DOM.

### 17. **What is the purpose of `key` in React?**
   - **Answer**: Keys are used in React to identify which items in a list are added, removed, or updated. They help React optimize rendering by minimizing the number of DOM updates.

### 18. **What is the difference between `ReactDOM.render` and `ReactDOM.hydrate`?**
   - **Answer**: `ReactDOM.render` is used to render a React component into the DOM. `ReactDOM.hydrate` is used to hydrate a server-rendered HTML page, ensuring that React can attach event listeners to the existing HTML markup.

### 19. **What is PropTypes in React?**
   - **Answer**: PropTypes is a library used to validate the types of props passed to components. It helps ensure that components receive the correct data types.

### 20. **What are pure components?**
   - **Answer**: Pure components are components that implement `shouldComponentUpdate` with a shallow comparison of props and state. This prevents unnecessary re-renders when the props and state have not changed.

### 21. **What is the difference between `setState` and `forceUpdate`?**
   - **Answer**: `setState` updates the state and triggers a re-render. `forceUpdate` forces the component to re-render, even if the state has not changed.

### 22. **What is the purpose of `React.lazy`?**
   - **Answer**: `React.lazy` is used to load components lazily, meaning they are loaded only when they are needed, improving the initial load time of the app.

### 23. **What is code splitting in React?**
   - **Answer**: Code splitting is a technique where the application code is split into smaller bundles, which are loaded on-demand. It improves the performance of large React apps by reducing the initial load time.

### 24. **What is `Suspense` in React?**
   - **Answer**: `Suspense` is a React component that allows you to show a loading indicator while waiting for lazy-loaded components to load.

### 25. **What is the role of the `render` method in a class component?**
   - **Answer**: The `render` method is required in class components. It returns the JSX (or React elements) that define what should be rendered to the DOM.

### 26. **What is the use of `shouldComponentUpdate`?**
   - **Answer**: `shouldComponentUpdate` is a lifecycle method in class components that allows you to prevent unnecessary re-renders by comparing the new and old props or state.

### 27. **What is `useReducer`?**
   - **Answer**: `useReducer` is a React hook used to manage complex state logic, often in place of `useState`. It’s useful when state transitions are more complex or involve multiple sub-values.

### 28. **What is `React.createElement`?**
   - **Answer**: `React.createElement` is a low-level method that React uses to create React elements. JSX gets transpiled to `React.createElement` calls behind the scenes.

### 29. **What is `setState` in React?**
   - **Answer**: `setState` is a method used in class components to update the state. It triggers a re-render of the component and its child components.

### 30. **What are higher-order components (HOCs)?**
   - **Answer**: HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional props or behavior. They allow for code reuse across components.

### 31. **What is the purpose of `React.StrictMode`?**
   - **Answer**: `React.StrictMode` is a tool for identifying potential problems in an application. It helps highlight unsafe lifecycle methods, legacy API usage, and other issues during development.

### 32. **What is `componentWillUnmount` used for?**
   - **Answer**: `componentWillUnmount` is a lifecycle method in class components that is called just before a component is removed from the DOM. It’s used for cleanup tasks like clearing timers or cancelling network requests.

### 33. **What is the `useContext` hook?**
   - **Answer**: The `useContext` hook is used to access values from a React context. It allows you to consume context data without using the `<Consumer>` component.

### 34. **What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript?**
   - **Answer**: `==` compares values for equality after type conversion, while `===` compares both the value and the type (strict equality).

### 35. **How can you prevent a component from re-rendering?**
   - **Answer**: You can prevent a component from re-rendering by using `shouldComponentUpdate` (in class components), `React.memo` (in functional components), or `Pure

Component`.

### 36. **What are default props in React?**
   - **Answer**: Default props are values set for props that a component receives. If the parent does not pass a specific prop, the default value is used.

### 37. **What is the purpose of `key` in lists?**
   - **Answer**: The `key` prop is used to uniquely identify elements in a list, helping React optimize rendering by updating only the changed elements.

### 38. **What is ReactDOM?**
   - **Answer**: `ReactDOM` is the package responsible for rendering React components into the DOM. It provides methods like `ReactDOM.render` to display components in the browser.

### 39. **What is a callback ref in React?**
   - **Answer**: A callback ref is a function used to access the DOM node or React component instance directly. It is passed as a `ref` and is called when the element is mounted or unmounted.

### 40. **What are side effects in React?**
   - **Answer**: Side effects are operations that interact with the outside world (like data fetching or DOM manipulation). They are handled by the `useEffect` hook in functional components.

### 41. **What is `React.memo`?**
   - **Answer**: `React.memo` is a higher-order component that memoizes functional components, preventing them from re-rendering if the props have not changed.

### 42. **How do you handle events in React?**
   - **Answer**: Events in React are handled using camelCase syntax and by passing event handler functions as props. For example, `onClick={handleClick}`.

### 43. **What are the lifecycle methods in React?**
   - **Answer**: Lifecycle methods are functions that get called at specific points during a component's existence. Key lifecycle methods include `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

### 44. **What is the purpose of `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode`?**
   - **Answer**: `ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode` is used to remove a mounted React component from the DOM.

### 45. **What are the advantages of using React?**
   - **Answer**: React offers benefits like reusable components, a virtual DOM for performance, unidirectional data flow, and a strong ecosystem of libraries and tools.

### 46. **What are render props in React?**
   - **Answer**: Render props is a pattern where a component’s logic is shared with other components using a function passed as a prop, which is then executed to return JSX.

### 47. **What is the `useRef` hook?**
   - **Answer**: The `useRef` hook is used to persist values across renders or to access DOM elements directly.

### 48. **What is the difference between `useEffect` and `useLayoutEffect`?**
   - **Answer**: `useEffect` runs after the render, while `useLayoutEffect` runs synchronously after all DOM mutations but before the browser has painted.

### 49. **What is the purpose of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`?**
   - **Answer**: `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` is used to set HTML directly in React. It’s called "dangerous" because it can expose the app to XSS attacks if used improperly.

### 50. **What is prop drilling?**
   - **Answer**: Prop drilling refers to the process of passing data from a parent component to deeply nested child components via props.
