**\# JavaScript Interview Questions & Answers**

Certainly! Below is a list of JavaScript-related questions that span beginner to advanced topics:

## Beginner-Level Questions
---

### 1\. **What is JavaScript?**

JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating interactive effects within web browsers. It allows developers to build interactive features on websites such as form validation, animations, and dynamic content updates.

### 2\. **What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?**

* `let`: Declares a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned.
* `const`: Declares a block-scoped variable whose value cannot be reassigned after initialization.
* `var`: Declares a function-scoped variable, which can be re-declared and reassigned (not recommended due to its behavior with hoisting).

```javascript
javascriptCopy codelet x = 5; // Can be reassigned
const y = 10; // Cannot be reassigned
var z = 15; // Function-scoped
```

### 3\. **What are the data types in JavaScript?**

JavaScript has seven basic data types:

* `String` (e.g., `"hello"`)
* `Number` (e.g., `42`)
* `BigInt` (e.g., `9007199254740991n`)
* `Boolean` (e.g., `true` or `false`)
* `undefined` (e.g., a variable that is declared but not assigned a value)
* `null` (e.g., an explicitly assigned empty value)
* `Symbol` (e.g., `Symbol('desc')`)
* `Object` (e.g., arrays, functions, and plain objects)

### 4\. **What is the difference between `==` and `===`?**

* `==`: Compares values for equality with type coercion.
* `===`: Compares values for equality without type coercion (strict equality).

```javascript
javascriptCopy code5 == '5'  // true because type coercion occurs
5 === '5' // false because types are different (number vs. string)
```

### 5\. **How do you create a function in JavaScript?**

There are multiple ways to define functions in JavaScript:

1. **Function Declaration**:

   ```javascript
   javascriptCopy codefunction greet() {
     console.log('Hello!');
   }
   ```

2. **Function Expression**:

   ```javascript
   javascriptCopy codeconst greet = function() {
     console.log('Hello!');
   };
   ```

3. **Arrow Function**:

   ```javascript
   javascriptCopy codeconst greet = () => console.log('Hello!');
   ```

### 6\. **What are the different ways to declare variables in JavaScript?**

* **`var`**: Function-scoped, can be redeclared.
* **`let`**: Block-scoped, can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope.
* **`const`**: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codevar a = 1;   // function-scoped
let b = 2;   // block-scoped
const c = 3; // block-scoped, cannot be reassigned
```

### 7\. **What is the purpose of the `typeof` operator?**

The `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of a variable or expression.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codetypeof 'hello';   // 'string'
typeof 42;        // 'number'
typeof true;      // 'boolean'
typeof undefined; // 'undefined'
typeof null;      // 'object' (a known JavaScript quirk)
```

### 8\. **Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.**

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope (function or global). Only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconsole.log(x);  // undefined
var x = 5;

console.log(y);  // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
let y = 10;
```

### 9\. **What are JavaScript arrays, and how do you create one?**

Arrays in JavaScript are ordered collections of items. You can create an array using square brackets `[]`.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
```

### 10\. **How do you add, remove, or access elements in an array?**

* **Add**: `push()` to add to the end, `unshift()` to add to the beginning.
* **Remove**: `pop()` to remove from the end, `shift()` to remove from the beginning.
* **Access**: Use the index (starting from 0).

```javascript
javascriptCopy codefruits.push('orange');      // Adds 'orange' to the end
fruits.unshift('grape');    // Adds 'grape' to the beginning
fruits.pop();               // Removes 'orange'
fruits.shift();             // Removes 'grape'
console.log(fruits[1]);     // Access the second element 'banana'
```

### 11\. **What is a loop? What are the different types of loops in JavaScript?**

A loop allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

Types of loops:

* **`for` loop**: Iterates a specific number of times.
* **`while` loop**: Loops as long as the condition is true.
* **`do...while` loop**: Loops at least once and then checks the condition.
* **`for...of` loop**: Iterates over iterable objects (e.g., arrays).
* **`for...in` loop**: Iterates over object properties.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codefor (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
for (const fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit); // apple, banana, cherry
}
```

### 12\. **What are JavaScript objects? How do you create one?**

Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs. You create an object using curly braces `{}`.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    console.log('Hello!');
  }
};
```

### 13\. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?**

* `undefined` means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.
* `null` is an intentional absence of any value (i.e., "empty").

```javascript
javascriptCopy codelet x;
console.log(x);  // undefined

let y = null;
console.log(y);  // null
```

### 14\. **How do you handle events in JavaScript?**

You can handle events by attaching event listeners to DOM elements using methods like `addEventListener`.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst button = document.querySelector('button');
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('Button clicked!');
});
```

### 15\. **What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?**

The `this` keyword refers to the context in which a function is called. Its value is determined by how the function is invoked.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }
};
person.greet(); // Hello, Alice
```

In global scope, `this` refers to the global object (`window` in browsers).

### 16\. **How does the `forEach()` method work?**

`forEach()` is an array method that executes a provided function once for each array element.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach((num) => {
  console.log(num);
});
// Output: 1, 2, 3
```

### 17\. **What is the purpose of `break` and `continue` statements?**

* `break`: Exits a loop or switch statement immediately.
* `continue`: Skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next iteration.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codefor (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    continue;  // Skips the iteration where i === 2
  }
  if (i === 4) {
    break;     // Exits the loop when i === 4
  }
  console.log(i);  // 0, 1, 3
}
```

### 18\. **What is a callback function in JavaScript?**

A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, and it is executed after the completion of the main function.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codefunction greet(name, callback) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
  callback();
}

function afterGreet() {
  console.log('Goodbye!');
}

greet('Alice', afterGreet); // Output: Hello, Alice
                            //         Goodbye!
```

## Intermediate-Level Questions

Sure! Here are the answers to the list of JavaScript questions:

### 1\. **What is closure in JavaScript?**

A **closure** is a function that "remembers" its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope. This happens because JavaScript functions are first-class objects and they maintain references to the environment in which they were created.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codefunction outer() {
  let counter = 0;
  return function inner() {
    counter++;
    console.log(counter);
  };
}

const increment = outer();  // closure is created here
increment(); // 1
increment(); // 2
```

### 2\. **What is the difference between function declarations and function expressions?**

* **Function Declaration**: A named function defined with the `function` keyword.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codefunction greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }
  ```

  Function declarations are hoisted, meaning they are available throughout the code.

* **Function Expression**: A function assigned to a variable, which may or may not be named.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst greet = function() {
    console.log("Hello");
  };
  ```

  Function expressions are not hoisted. The function is only available after the assignment.

### 3\. **What is the purpose of setTimeout() and setInterval()?**

* **`setTimeout()`**: Executes a function once after a specified delay.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codesetTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Executed after 2 seconds");
  }, 2000);
  ```

* **`setInterval()`**: Repeatedly executes a function at specified intervals (in milliseconds).

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codesetInterval(() => {
    console.log("Executed every 2 seconds");
  }, 2000);
  ```

### 4\. **Explain the concept of promises and how then() and catch() work.**

A **promise** represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It can be in one of three states: **pending**, **fulfilled**, or **rejected**.

* **`then()`**: Registers a callback to be executed when the promise is fulfilled.
* **`catch()`**: Registers a callback to be executed when the promise is rejected.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let success = true;
  if (success) {
    resolve("Operation successful");
  } else {
    reject("Operation failed");
  }
});

promise.then(result => {
  console.log(result);  // "Operation successful"
}).catch(error => {
  console.log(error);   // "Operation failed"
});
```

### 5\. **What is async/await in JavaScript?**

**`async/await`** is a modern syntax for handling asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like fashion.

* **`async`**: Marks a function as asynchronous and automatically returns a promise.
* **`await`**: Pauses the execution of the `async` function until a promise is resolved.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeasync function fetchData() {
  let result = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  let data = await result.json();
  console.log(data);
}

fetchData();
```

### 6\. **What are arrow functions, and how do they differ from regular functions?**

Arrow functions are a shorthand syntax for writing functions. They are more concise and do not have their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target`. Arrow functions inherit `this` from their lexical scope.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy code// Regular function
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Arrow function
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
```

**Difference**: Arrow functions are not hoisted and do not have their own `this`.

### 7\. **What is event delegation in JavaScript?**

**Event delegation** is a technique where instead of adding event listeners to individual child elements, you add a single event listener to a parent element. The event listener is triggered when an event bubbles up from a child element.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codedocument.querySelector('#parent').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  if (event.target && event.target.matches('button')) {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
  }
});
```

### 8\. **What is the event loop in JavaScript?**

The **event loop** is a mechanism that handles asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It continuously checks the call stack and the message queue. When the call stack is empty, it pushes tasks from the message queue to the call stack for execution.

* The event loop enables JavaScript to execute asynchronous code, like setTimeout, promises, and I/O operations, without blocking the main thread.

### 9\. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?**

* **Synchronous code**: Executes sequentially, blocking the next operation until the current one is completed.
* **Asynchronous code**: Executes independently, allowing other operations to run without waiting for it to complete.

Example:

* Synchronous:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconsole.log("First");
  console.log("Second");
  ```

* Asynchronous (with `setTimeout`):

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconsole.log("First");
  setTimeout(() => console.log("Second"), 1000);
  console.log("Third");
  ```

### 10\. **How does JavaScript handle asynchronous code (callbacks, promises, async/await)?**

* **Callbacks**: Functions passed as arguments to other functions to be executed later, usually once an asynchronous operation is completed.
* **Promises**: Represent a value that may be available now or in the future, allowing chaining of `.then()` and `.catch()`.
* **Async/Await**: Allows asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous style, simplifying handling of asynchronous operations.

### 11\. **What is the difference between call(), apply(), and bind() in JavaScript?**

These methods are used to change the context (`this`) of a function.

* **`call()`**: Invokes the function immediately with a specified `this` value and arguments.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codefunction greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
  }
  greet.call(this, 'Alice');
  ```

* **`apply()`**: Similar to `call()`, but arguments are passed as an array.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codegreet.apply(this, ['Alice']);
  ```

* **`bind()`**: Returns a new function with a specified `this` value, but it does not invoke the function immediately.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst greetAlice = greet.bind(this, 'Alice');
  greetAlice();
  ```

### 12\. **What are the map(), filter(), and reduce() methods?**

* **`map()`**: Creates a new array by applying a function to each element in an existing array.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];
  const squares = numbers.map(x => x * x);  // [1, 4, 9]
  ```

* **`filter()`**: Creates a new array with elements that pass a given condition.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(x => x % 2 === 0);  // [2, 4]
  ```

* **`reduce()`**: Reduces the array to a single value based on a function.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];
  const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);  // 6
  ```

### 13\. **What is the spread operator (...), and how is it used?**

The **spread operator** (`...`) is used to unpack elements from an array or object, or to spread values in function calls or array literals.

Example:

* **Arrays**:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst arr1 = [1, 2];
  const arr2 = [...arr1, 3, 4];  // [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```

* **Objects**:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
  const obj2 = { ...obj1, age: 25 };  // { name: "Alice", age: 25 }
  ```

### 14\. **What is destructuring in JavaScript?**

**Destructuring** allows you to extract values from arrays or objects into variables in a concise way.

* **Array Destructuring**:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst arr = [1, 2, 3];
  const [a, b] = arr;  // a = 1, b = 2
  ```

* **Object Destructuring**:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
  const { name, age } = person;  // name = "Alice", age = 25
  ```

### 15\. **How does JavaScript handle errors with try, catch, and finally?**

* **`try`**: Executes code that might throw an error.
* **`catch`**: Handles errors if any occur in the `try` block.
* **`finally`**: Executes code after `try`/`catch`, regardless of whether an error occurred.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codetry {
  let result = riskyOperation();
} catch (error) {
  console.error("An error occurred", error);
} finally {
  console.log("Always runs");
}
```

### 16\. **What are modules in JavaScript, and how do you export and import them?**

**Modules** allow you to split your code into smaller, reusable pieces.

* **Exporting**:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy code// export.js
  export const greeting = "Hello";
  export function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }
  ```

* **Importing**:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy code// import.js
  import { greeting, sayHello } from './export.js';
  console.log(greeting);  // "Hello"
  sayHello();             // "Hello"
  ```

## Advanced-Level Questions

Sure! Let's dive into these JavaScript concepts in detail.

---

### 1\. **What is the prototype chain in JavaScript?**

The **prototype chain** is a fundamental feature in JavaScript that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. Every JavaScript object has a `[[Prototype]]` property (also accessible via `__proto__`), which refers to another object. If a property or method is called on an object and it doesn’t exist on that object, JavaScript looks up the chain to the object's prototype, then the prototype's prototype, and so on, until it either finds the property or reaches the end of the chain (i.e., `Object.prototype`, which is `null`).

### 2\. **What is the `bind()` method used for in JavaScript?**

The `bind()` method in JavaScript is used to create a **new function** that, when invoked, has its `this` value set to a specific object and allows pre-setting parameters (partial function application). It doesn’t immediately call the function but returns a new function with the specified context.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst obj = { value: 42 };
const getValue = function() {
  return this.value;
};

const boundGetValue = getValue.bind(obj);
console.log(boundGetValue());  // 42
```

### 3\. **What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy?**

* **Shallow copy**: Creates a new object but only copies the top-level properties. If the property is an object, it still refers to the same object in memory (i.e., nested objects are not copied, but referenced).
* **Deep copy**: Creates a new object and recursively copies all the properties, including nested objects, ensuring that no references to the original objects remain.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codelet shallowCopy = [...originalArray]; // shallow copy
let deepCopy = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(originalArray)); // deep copy (works with JSON-serializable data)
```

### 4\. **What are IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expressions), and when are they used?**

An **IIFE** is a function expression that is defined and executed immediately. It is often used to create a new scope to avoid polluting the global namespace or to encapsulate logic within a function.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy code(function() {
  // This function runs immediately
  console.log('Hello from IIFE');
})();
```

IIFE is commonly used in JavaScript modules, closures, and when you want to avoid polluting the global scope.

### 5\. **What is the difference between `Object.create()` and the `new` keyword in JavaScript?**

* **`Object.create(proto)`**: Creates a new object with the specified prototype object (`proto`). It doesn't run a constructor function. Example:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst obj = Object.create(protoObject);
  ```

* **`new` keyword**: Creates a new object, sets the prototype to the constructor's prototype, and executes the constructor function. Example:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codefunction Person(name) {
    this.name = name;
  }
  const person = new Person('Alice');
  ```

### 6\. **Explain the concept of JavaScript design patterns, such as Singleton or Module.**

* **Design Patterns** are reusable solutions to common software design problems. In JavaScript, some common patterns are:

  * **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

    ```javascript
    javascriptCopy codeconst Singleton = (function() {
      let instance;
      function createInstance() {
        return new Object('I am a singleton');
      }
      return {
        getInstance: function() {
          if (!instance) {
            instance = createInstance();
          }
          return instance;
        }
      };
    })();
    ```

  * **Module Pattern**: Used to encapsulate private data and expose only certain methods, maintaining a clean namespace.

    ```javascript
    javascriptCopy codeconst Module = (function() {
      let privateVar = 'I am private';
      return {
        publicMethod: function() {
          console.log(privateVar);
        }
      };
    })();
    ```

### 7\. **What is the purpose of the `Symbol` type in JavaScript?**

`Symbol` is a primitive data type introduced in ES6, used to create **unique identifiers** for object properties. Symbols are often used to avoid property name collisions, particularly for non-enumerable properties.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst sym = Symbol('description');
const obj = {
  [sym]: 'value'
};
console.log(obj[sym]); // 'value'
```

### 8\. **How does JavaScript event delegation work, and why is it useful?**

Event delegation is a technique where instead of attaching event listeners to each individual element, you attach a single listener to a parent element. This works by leveraging the event bubbling mechanism, where events propagate from the target element up through the DOM tree.

It’s useful because it reduces memory usage and allows handling events for dynamically added elements.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codedocument.querySelector('#parent').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  if (event.target && event.target.matches('button.className')) {
    // Handle the button click event
  }
});
```

### 9\. **What are Web Workers, and how do they work in JavaScript?**

**Web Workers** allow JavaScript to run in the background on a separate thread, without blocking the main thread. They are useful for tasks that are CPU-intensive or require heavy computations (e.g., large data processing) without freezing the UI.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst worker = new Worker('worker.js');
worker.postMessage('Hello Worker!');
worker.onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log('Received from worker:', event.data);
};
```

### 10\. **What are generators in JavaScript, and how do they differ from regular functions?**

Generators are functions that can pause execution and later resume from where they left off using the `yield` keyword. They return an iterator, which allows you to iterate over the function’s yielded values.

Difference:

* Regular functions execute from start to finish.
* Generators can pause with `yield` and resume when `next()` is called.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codefunction* myGenerator() {
  yield 1;
  yield 2;
  yield 3;
}
const gen = myGenerator();
console.log(gen.next().value); // 1
console.log(gen.next().value); // 2
```

### 11\. **What are the Proxy and Reflect objects in JavaScript?**

* **Proxy**: A special object that allows you to define custom behavior for fundamental operations (e.g., property lookup, assignment, function invocation). Example:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst proxy = new Proxy(target, handler);
  ```

* **Reflect**: A built-in object that provides methods for intercepting and manipulating JavaScript operations (e.g., getting and setting properties). It is often used in conjunction with `Proxy`. Example:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeReflect.set(target, 'prop', value);
  ```

### 12\. **What is memory management and garbage collection in JavaScript?**

Memory management in JavaScript involves allocating and freeing up memory when objects are no longer needed. **Garbage Collection (GC)** automatically reclaims memory used by objects that are no longer reachable or referenced. JavaScript's garbage collector mainly uses **mark-and-sweep** and **reference counting** algorithms.

### 13\. **How does JavaScript handle concurrency with async/await, Promises, and Event Loop?**

JavaScript uses an **event loop** to manage asynchronous operations, allowing non-blocking execution.

* **Promises**: Represent a value that may be available now, in the future, or never.
* **async/await**: Allows asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous-like style.
* The **Event Loop** ensures that asynchronous callbacks are processed after the current stack of synchronous operations is completed.

### 14\. **What is debouncing and throttling in JavaScript, and how do they work?**

* **Debouncing**: Ensures that a function is only called after a certain delay, preventing excessive function calls. Commonly used for events like scrolling, resizing, or keypresses.
* **Throttling**: Ensures that a function is called at most once in a specified period, regardless of how many times the event is triggered.

Example:

* **Debounce**: Delay before firing the function after the last event.
* **Throttle**: Limit the number of times the function is called within a time window.

### 15\. **How do you optimize performance in large-scale JavaScript applications?**

Optimization techniques include:

* Minifying and compressing JavaScript.
* Using lazy loading and dynamic imports.
* Code splitting.
* Avoiding excessive DOM manipulation.
* Reducing reflows and repaints.
* Using Web Workers for heavy computations.

### 16\. **Explain how JavaScript works in the browser: What happens when a webpage loads?**

When a webpage loads, the browser performs the following steps:

1. **Parsing HTML**: Builds the DOM (Document Object Model).
2. **Parsing CSS**: Builds the CSSOM (CSS Object Model).
3. **Rendering**: Combines DOM and CSSOM to render the page.
4. **JavaScript Execution**: Executes any embedded JavaScript, modifying the DOM/CSSOM and handling events.

The **event loop** coordinates asynchronous tasks while executing the synchronous code.

### 17\. **What is the difference between localStorage, sessionStorage, and cookies in JavaScript?**

* **localStorage**: Stores data persistently, even after the browser is closed.
* **sessionStorage**: Stores data for the duration of the page session (data is cleared when the page is closed).
* **Cookies**: Can store data with an expiration date and are sent with every HTTP request.
