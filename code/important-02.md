**\# JavaScript Interview Questions & Answers**

Certainly! Below is a list of JavaScript-related questions that span beginner to advanced topics:

## Beginner-Level Questions
---

### 1\. **What is JavaScript?**

JavaScript is a dynamic, interpreted programming language primarily used for creating interactive effects within web browsers. It allows developers to build interactive features on websites such as form validation, animations, and dynamic content updates.

### 2\. **What is the difference between `let`, `const`, and `var`?**

* `let`: Declares a block-scoped variable that can be reassigned.
* `const`: Declares a block-scoped variable whose value cannot be reassigned after initialization.
* `var`: Declares a function-scoped variable, which can be re-declared and reassigned (not recommended due to its behavior with hoisting).

```javascript
javascriptCopy codelet x = 5; // Can be reassigned
const y = 10; // Cannot be reassigned
var z = 15; // Function-scoped
```

### 3\. **What are the data types in JavaScript?**

JavaScript has seven basic data types:

* `String` (e.g., `"hello"`)
* `Number` (e.g., `42`)
* `BigInt` (e.g., `9007199254740991n`)
* `Boolean` (e.g., `true` or `false`)
* `undefined` (e.g., a variable that is declared but not assigned a value)
* `null` (e.g., an explicitly assigned empty value)
* `Symbol` (e.g., `Symbol('desc')`)
* `Object` (e.g., arrays, functions, and plain objects)

### 4\. **What is the difference between `==` and `===`?**

* `==`: Compares values for equality with type coercion.
* `===`: Compares values for equality without type coercion (strict equality).

```javascript
javascriptCopy code5 == '5'  // true because type coercion occurs
5 === '5' // false because types are different (number vs. string)
```

### 5\. **How do you create a function in JavaScript?**

There are multiple ways to define functions in JavaScript:

1. **Function Declaration**:

   ```javascript
   javascriptCopy codefunction greet() {
     console.log('Hello!');
   }
   ```

2. **Function Expression**:

   ```javascript
   javascriptCopy codeconst greet = function() {
     console.log('Hello!');
   };
   ```

3. **Arrow Function**:

   ```javascript
   javascriptCopy codeconst greet = () => console.log('Hello!');
   ```

### 6\. **What are the different ways to declare variables in JavaScript?**

* **`var`**: Function-scoped, can be redeclared.
* **`let`**: Block-scoped, can be reassigned but not redeclared in the same scope.
* **`const`**: Block-scoped, cannot be reassigned or redeclared.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codevar a = 1;   // function-scoped
let b = 2;   // block-scoped
const c = 3; // block-scoped, cannot be reassigned
```

### 7\. **What is the purpose of the `typeof` operator?**

The `typeof` operator returns a string indicating the type of a variable or expression.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codetypeof 'hello';   // 'string'
typeof 42;        // 'number'
typeof true;      // 'boolean'
typeof undefined; // 'undefined'
typeof null;      // 'object' (a known JavaScript quirk)
```

### 8\. **Explain the concept of hoisting in JavaScript.**

Hoisting is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top of the current scope (function or global). Only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconsole.log(x);  // undefined
var x = 5;

console.log(y);  // ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization
let y = 10;
```

### 9\. **What are JavaScript arrays, and how do you create one?**

Arrays in JavaScript are ordered collections of items. You can create an array using square brackets `[]`.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
```

### 10\. **How do you add, remove, or access elements in an array?**

* **Add**: `push()` to add to the end, `unshift()` to add to the beginning.
* **Remove**: `pop()` to remove from the end, `shift()` to remove from the beginning.
* **Access**: Use the index (starting from 0).

```javascript
javascriptCopy codefruits.push('orange');      // Adds 'orange' to the end
fruits.unshift('grape');    // Adds 'grape' to the beginning
fruits.pop();               // Removes 'orange'
fruits.shift();             // Removes 'grape'
console.log(fruits[1]);     // Access the second element 'banana'
```

### 11\. **What is a loop? What are the different types of loops in JavaScript?**

A loop allows you to repeat a block of code multiple times.

Types of loops:

* **`for` loop**: Iterates a specific number of times.
* **`while` loop**: Loops as long as the condition is true.
* **`do...while` loop**: Loops at least once and then checks the condition.
* **`for...of` loop**: Iterates over iterable objects (e.g., arrays).
* **`for...in` loop**: Iterates over object properties.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codefor (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  console.log(i); // 0, 1, 2, 3, 4
}

let i = 0;
while (i < 5) {
  console.log(i);
  i++;
}

let fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry'];
for (const fruit of fruits) {
  console.log(fruit); // apple, banana, cherry
}
```

### 12\. **What are JavaScript objects? How do you create one?**

Objects in JavaScript are collections of key-value pairs. You create an object using curly braces `{}`.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst person = {
  name: 'John',
  age: 30,
  greet() {
    console.log('Hello!');
  }
};
```

### 13\. **What is the difference between `null` and `undefined`?**

* `undefined` means a variable has been declared but not assigned a value.
* `null` is an intentional absence of any value (i.e., "empty").

```javascript
javascriptCopy codelet x;
console.log(x);  // undefined

let y = null;
console.log(y);  // null
```

### 14\. **How do you handle events in JavaScript?**

You can handle events by attaching event listeners to DOM elements using methods like `addEventListener`.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst button = document.querySelector('button');
button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  alert('Button clicked!');
});
```

### 15\. **What is the `this` keyword in JavaScript?**

The `this` keyword refers to the context in which a function is called. Its value is determined by how the function is invoked.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst person = {
  name: 'Alice',
  greet: function() {
    console.log(`Hello, ${this.name}`);
  }
};
person.greet(); // Hello, Alice
```

In global scope, `this` refers to the global object (`window` in browsers).

### 16\. **How does the `forEach()` method work?**

`forEach()` is an array method that executes a provided function once for each array element.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];
numbers.forEach((num) => {
  console.log(num);
});
// Output: 1, 2, 3
```

### 17\. **What is the purpose of `break` and `continue` statements?**

* `break`: Exits a loop or switch statement immediately.
* `continue`: Skips the current iteration of a loop and continues with the next iteration.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codefor (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  if (i === 2) {
    continue;  // Skips the iteration where i === 2
  }
  if (i === 4) {
    break;     // Exits the loop when i === 4
  }
  console.log(i);  // 0, 1, 3
}
```

### 18\. **What is a callback function in JavaScript?**

A callback function is a function passed as an argument to another function, and it is executed after the completion of the main function.

```javascript
javascriptCopy codefunction greet(name, callback) {
  console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
  callback();
}

function afterGreet() {
  console.log('Goodbye!');
}

greet('Alice', afterGreet); // Output: Hello, Alice
                            //         Goodbye!
```

## Intermediate-Level Questions

Sure! Here are the answers to the list of JavaScript questions:

### 1\. **What is closure in JavaScript?**

A **closure** is a function that "remembers" its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that scope. This happens because JavaScript functions are first-class objects and they maintain references to the environment in which they were created.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codefunction outer() {
  let counter = 0;
  return function inner() {
    counter++;
    console.log(counter);
  };
}

const increment = outer();  // closure is created here
increment(); // 1
increment(); // 2
```

### 2\. **What is the difference between function declarations and function expressions?**

* **Function Declaration**: A named function defined with the `function` keyword.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codefunction greet() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }
  ```

  Function declarations are hoisted, meaning they are available throughout the code.

* **Function Expression**: A function assigned to a variable, which may or may not be named.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst greet = function() {
    console.log("Hello");
  };
  ```

  Function expressions are not hoisted. The function is only available after the assignment.

### 3\. **What is the purpose of setTimeout() and setInterval()?**

* **`setTimeout()`**: Executes a function once after a specified delay.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codesetTimeout(() => {
    console.log("Executed after 2 seconds");
  }, 2000);
  ```

* **`setInterval()`**: Repeatedly executes a function at specified intervals (in milliseconds).

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codesetInterval(() => {
    console.log("Executed every 2 seconds");
  }, 2000);
  ```

### 4\. **Explain the concept of promises and how then() and catch() work.**

A **promise** represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It can be in one of three states: **pending**, **fulfilled**, or **rejected**.

* **`then()`**: Registers a callback to be executed when the promise is fulfilled.
* **`catch()`**: Registers a callback to be executed when the promise is rejected.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeconst promise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let success = true;
  if (success) {
    resolve("Operation successful");
  } else {
    reject("Operation failed");
  }
});

promise.then(result => {
  console.log(result);  // "Operation successful"
}).catch(error => {
  console.log(error);   // "Operation failed"
});
```

### 5\. **What is async/await in JavaScript?**

**`async/await`** is a modern syntax for handling asynchronous code in a more synchronous-like fashion.

* **`async`**: Marks a function as asynchronous and automatically returns a promise.
* **`await`**: Pauses the execution of the `async` function until a promise is resolved.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codeasync function fetchData() {
  let result = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  let data = await result.json();
  console.log(data);
}

fetchData();
```

### 6\. **What are arrow functions, and how do they differ from regular functions?**

Arrow functions are a shorthand syntax for writing functions. They are more concise and do not have their own `this`, `arguments`, `super`, or `new.target`. Arrow functions inherit `this` from their lexical scope.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy code// Regular function
function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}

// Arrow function
const sum = (a, b) => a + b;
```

**Difference**: Arrow functions are not hoisted and do not have their own `this`.

### 7\. **What is event delegation in JavaScript?**

**Event delegation** is a technique where instead of adding event listeners to individual child elements, you add a single event listener to a parent element. The event listener is triggered when an event bubbles up from a child element.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codedocument.querySelector('#parent').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
  if (event.target && event.target.matches('button')) {
    console.log('Button clicked!');
  }
});
```

### 8\. **What is the event loop in JavaScript?**

The **event loop** is a mechanism that handles asynchronous operations in JavaScript. It continuously checks the call stack and the message queue. When the call stack is empty, it pushes tasks from the message queue to the call stack for execution.

* The event loop enables JavaScript to execute asynchronous code, like setTimeout, promises, and I/O operations, without blocking the main thread.

### 9\. **What is the difference between synchronous and asynchronous code?**

* **Synchronous code**: Executes sequentially, blocking the next operation until the current one is completed.
* **Asynchronous code**: Executes independently, allowing other operations to run without waiting for it to complete.

Example:

* Synchronous:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconsole.log("First");
  console.log("Second");
  ```

* Asynchronous (with `setTimeout`):

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconsole.log("First");
  setTimeout(() => console.log("Second"), 1000);
  console.log("Third");
  ```

### 10\. **How does JavaScript handle asynchronous code (callbacks, promises, async/await)?**

* **Callbacks**: Functions passed as arguments to other functions to be executed later, usually once an asynchronous operation is completed.
* **Promises**: Represent a value that may be available now or in the future, allowing chaining of `.then()` and `.catch()`.
* **Async/Await**: Allows asynchronous code to be written in a synchronous style, simplifying handling of asynchronous operations.

### 11\. **What is the difference between call(), apply(), and bind() in JavaScript?**

These methods are used to change the context (`this`) of a function.

* **`call()`**: Invokes the function immediately with a specified `this` value and arguments.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codefunction greet(name) {
    console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
  }
  greet.call(this, 'Alice');
  ```

* **`apply()`**: Similar to `call()`, but arguments are passed as an array.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codegreet.apply(this, ['Alice']);
  ```

* **`bind()`**: Returns a new function with a specified `this` value, but it does not invoke the function immediately.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst greetAlice = greet.bind(this, 'Alice');
  greetAlice();
  ```

### 12\. **What are the map(), filter(), and reduce() methods?**

* **`map()`**: Creates a new array by applying a function to each element in an existing array.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];
  const squares = numbers.map(x => x * x);  // [1, 4, 9]
  ```

* **`filter()`**: Creates a new array with elements that pass a given condition.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];
  const evenNumbers = numbers.filter(x => x % 2 === 0);  // [2, 4]
  ```

* **`reduce()`**: Reduces the array to a single value based on a function.

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst numbers = [1, 2, 3];
  const sum = numbers.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);  // 6
  ```

### 13\. **What is the spread operator (...), and how is it used?**

The **spread operator** (`...`) is used to unpack elements from an array or object, or to spread values in function calls or array literals.

Example:

* **Arrays**:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst arr1 = [1, 2];
  const arr2 = [...arr1, 3, 4];  // [1, 2, 3, 4]
  ```

* **Objects**:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst obj1 = { name: "Alice" };
  const obj2 = { ...obj1, age: 25 };  // { name: "Alice", age: 25 }
  ```

### 14\. **What is destructuring in JavaScript?**

**Destructuring** allows you to extract values from arrays or objects into variables in a concise way.

* **Array Destructuring**:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst arr = [1, 2, 3];
  const [a, b] = arr;  // a = 1, b = 2
  ```

* **Object Destructuring**:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy codeconst person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 };
  const { name, age } = person;  // name = "Alice", age = 25
  ```

### 15\. **How does JavaScript handle errors with try, catch, and finally?**

* **`try`**: Executes code that might throw an error.
* **`catch`**: Handles errors if any occur in the `try` block.
* **`finally`**: Executes code after `try`/`catch`, regardless of whether an error occurred.

Example:

```javascript
javascriptCopy codetry {
  let result = riskyOperation();
} catch (error) {
  console.error("An error occurred", error);
} finally {
  console.log("Always runs");
}
```

### 16\. **What are modules in JavaScript, and how do you export and import them?**

**Modules** allow you to split your code into smaller, reusable pieces.

* **Exporting**:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy code// export.js
  export const greeting = "Hello";
  export function sayHello() {
    console.log("Hello");
  }
  ```

* **Importing**:

  ```javascript
  javascriptCopy code// import.js
  import { greeting, sayHello } from './export.js';
  console.log(greeting);  // "Hello"
  sayHello();             // "Hello"
  ```
