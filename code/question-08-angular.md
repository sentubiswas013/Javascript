Here is a list of potential interview questions for a Senior Angular Developer. These questions cover a wide range of topics including Angular fundamentals, advanced concepts, performance optimization, testing, and best practices. You can use this list to assess both technical knowledge and problem-solving abilities:

* What is data binding in Angular? Can you explain the different types (e.g., one-way binding, two-way binding)?
* What is Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular, and how does it work?
* How do you create a service in Angular, and how would you inject it into a component or another service?

### **2\. Advanced Angular Features**

* What is the Angular Router, and how would you set up routing in an Angular application?
* Explain lazy loading in Angular. How does it improve performance?
* What are Angular modules, and how do you organize them effectively in large applications?
* What is the difference between `ngOnInit()` and `ngAfterViewInit()`? In which situations would you use each?
* What is the purpose of `ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush`? How does it optimize performance?
* What are the various types of Angular pipes, and when would you use a custom pipe?
* How do you handle form validation in Angular? Can you explain the difference between template-driven forms and reactive forms?
* Can you explain the use of `ngContent` and `ngTemplate` in Angular?

### **3\. Angular Performance Optimization**

* How do you optimize the performance of an Angular application? (e.g., lazy loading, change detection strategy, trackBy in \*ngFor)
* How would you troubleshoot performance issues in Angular? What tools and techniques would you use?
* Explain the difference between `trackBy` and `ngFor` in terms of performance optimization.
* What is the role of the `async` pipe in Angular? How does it improve performance with observables?
* How can you reduce the bundle size of an Angular application?

### **4\. RxJS and Observables**

* What are Observables in Angular? Can you explain how they are used with HTTP requests and other asynchronous operations?
* How do you handle error handling in RxJS streams?
* What is the difference between `switchMap`, `concatMap`, and `mergeMap` in RxJS? Provide examples of when to use each.
* What are higher-order mapping operators in RxJS? Can you explain how `concatMap` and `switchMap` differ?
* How would you manage state in Angular using RxJS?

### **5\. Angular Testing**

* How do you approach unit testing in Angular? What tools and libraries do you use for testing? (e.g., Jasmine, Karma, Jest)
* What is the purpose of `TestBed` in Angular testing, and how do you use it to configure tests?
* How do you mock services and HTTP requests during unit tests in Angular?
* Explain how to test an Angular component that has dependencies like services, observables, or other components.
* Can you explain the concept of a "spy" in Jasmine? How would you use it in unit testing?

### **6\. Architecture & Design Patterns**

* How would you organize a large Angular application? What folder structure would you use, and how would you manage dependencies?
* Explain the concept of "state management" in Angular. What tools or libraries (e.g., NgRx, Akita) would you use for state management, and why?
* How would you design a scalable, maintainable, and testable Angular application?
* What is the Singleton pattern, and how does Angular utilize it with services?
* Can you explain the concept of "component communication" in Angular? How would you pass data between parent and child components?

### **7\. Angular and Backend Integration**

* How would you handle authentication and authorization in an Angular application? Can you explain JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and how it works with Angular?
* How would you handle API calls in Angular? Explain the use of `HttpClient` and how you would manage request/response handling and error handling.
* What are interceptors in Angular? How would you use them for adding headers or logging API requests?
* How would you handle file uploads in Angular? What are the best practices for handling large files?

### **8\. Security**

* What are some common security concerns in Angular applications? How would you mitigate them? (e.g., XSS, CSRF)
* How does Angular prevent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)? What measures would you take to prevent it?
* Explain how to secure an Angular app in a production environment. What steps would you take for securing API communication?

### **9\. Angular CLI and Build Tools**

* How would you use Angular CLI to create and manage an Angular application? Can you explain the common commands used in development?
* What is Angular Universal, and how does it enable server-side rendering (SSR)?
* Can you explain the purpose of `angular.json`? What kind of configurations can be done there?
* How do you create custom Angular schematics using Angular CLI?
* What is Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation, and how does it differ from Just-in-Time (JIT) compilation?

### **10\. Miscellaneous**

* What is your experience with integrating Angular with other frameworks or technologies (e.g., Angular with React, Angular with Webpack)?
* What are some of the most challenging problems youâ€™ve faced while working with Angular, and how did you solve them?
* How do you stay up to date with new releases and changes in the Angular framework?
* Can you walk us through a specific project where you applied Angular to solve a complex problem? What were the challenges, and how did you address them?

These questions aim to assess a Senior Angular Developer's knowledge in both the foundational and advanced aspects of the framework, as well as problem-solving, best practices, and performance optimization. You can adjust the depth and complexity of the questions based on the candidate's experience level.
