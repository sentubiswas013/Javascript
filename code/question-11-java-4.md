Here is a comprehensive list of 100 Java interview questions along with their brief answers:

### 1. **What is Java?**
   Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle). It is designed to be platform-independent, meaning Java code can run on any platform that supports the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

### 2. **What are the features of Java?**

   - Simple and secure
   - Multithreading support
   - High performance
   - Distributed computing

### 7. **What are the four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming?**
   - **Encapsulation**: Hiding the internal state and requiring all interaction to be performed through methods.
   - **Abstraction**: Hiding complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features.
   - **Inheritance**: The ability of a class to inherit fields and methods from another class.
   - **Polymorphism**: The ability of one method or function to behave differently based on the object or parameters.

### 8. **What is method overloading in Java?**
   Method overloading occurs when multiple methods with the same name but different parameters (either by type, number, or both) are defined in the same class.

### 9. **What is method overriding in Java?**
   Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.

### 10. **What is the difference between overloading and overriding?**
