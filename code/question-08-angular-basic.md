Here are 50 beginner-level Angular interview questions along with their answers:

### 1. **What is Angular?**
   **Answer:** Angular is a platform and framework for building single-page client applications using HTML and TypeScript. It is developed and maintained by Google and uses a component-based architecture.

### 2. **What is the difference between Angular and AngularJS?**
   **Answer:** AngularJS is the first version of Angular, which uses JavaScript. Angular (2 and above) is a complete rewrite using TypeScript, offering improved performance, better tooling, and a modular architecture.

### 3. **What are Components in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Components are the basic building blocks of Angular applications. They consist of an HTML template, a CSS style, and a TypeScript class to handle logic. Each component controls a part of the screen and can interact with other components.

### 4. **What is a Module in Angular?**
   **Answer:** A module is a container for various components, services, and other Angular entities. It helps in organizing the code in an application. The root module is usually `AppModule`.

### 5. **What is Data Binding in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Data binding is a mechanism that allows synchronization of data between the model (component) and the view (template). Angular supports:
   - **One-way data binding:** Property binding, event binding.
   - **Two-way data binding:** Using `[(ngModel)]`.

### 6. **What is Directives in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Directives are special markers on elements in the DOM that add behavior to those elements. There are three types:
   - **Structural directives:** Modify the structure of the DOM (`*ngIf`, `*ngFor`).
   - **Attribute directives:** Change the appearance or behavior of an element (`ngClass`, `ngStyle`).
   - **Component directives:** Behave like components.

### 7. **What is a Service in Angular?**
   **Answer:** A service is a class in Angular used to share data and logic across multiple components. They can be injected into components, other services, or modules via dependency injection.

### 8. **What is Dependency Injection (DI) in Angular?**
   **Answer:** DI is a design pattern used in Angular to achieve Inversion of Control. Angular's DI system provides dependencies (services) to components and other services automatically.

### 9. **What is Routing in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Routing in Angular enables navigation between views or components. It allows for creating a single-page application (SPA) where content can change dynamically without refreshing the entire page.

### 10. **What are Pipes in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Pipes are used to transform data in templates. Angular provides built-in pipes like `DatePipe`, `UpperCasePipe`, `CurrencyPipe`, etc., and you can also create custom pipes.

### 11. **What is the purpose of Angular CLI?**
   **Answer:** Angular CLI (Command Line Interface) is a tool to automate tasks like project creation, development server setup, build, testing, and deployment of Angular applications.

### 12. **Explain the lifecycle hooks in Angular.**
   **Answer:** Angular lifecycle hooks are methods that allow developers to tap into the lifecycle of a component or directive. Common lifecycle hooks include:
   - `ngOnInit()`: Called once the component is initialized.
   - `ngOnChanges()`: Called when an input property changes.
   - `ngDoCheck()`: Called during every change detection cycle.
   - `ngOnDestroy()`: Called just before the component is destroyed.

### 13. **What is the difference between `ngOnInit` and `ngAfterViewInit`?**
   **Answer:** `ngOnInit` is called once the component's data-bound properties are initialized. `ngAfterViewInit` is called after Angular has fully initialized the component's view.

### 14. **What are Observables in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Observables are a core part of Angular's reactive programming model. They allow asynchronous operations and provide methods to subscribe to data streams.

### 15. **What is the difference between `subscribe()` and `async pipe`?**
   **Answer:** `subscribe()` is used in component classes to manage the data stream programmatically, while `async pipe` is used in templates to automatically subscribe to observables and manage the subscription lifecycle.

### 16. **What is `ngFor`?**
   **Answer:** `ngFor` is a structural directive used to iterate over an array or list and render a template for each item. For example: 
   ```html
   <div *ngFor="let item of items">{{ item }}</div>
   ```

### 17. **What is `ngIf`?**
   **Answer:** `ngIf` is a structural directive that conditionally includes or excludes a template from the DOM based on a boolean expression.

### 18. **What is the role of `ngModel` in Angular?**
   **Answer:** `ngModel` provides two-way data binding. It binds input elements with component properties, allowing for automatic synchronization of data between the view and the model.

### 19. **What is the Angular Router Module?**
   **Answer:** The Angular Router module is responsible for navigation within a single-page application. It maps URL paths to components and handles route transitions.

### 20. **What is a form in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Forms in Angular are used to handle user input. Angular provides two types of forms:
   - **Template-driven forms** (easy and declarative approach).
   - **Reactive forms** (more powerful, better suited for complex forms).

### 21. **What is the difference between Template-driven and Reactive forms?**
   **Answer:** Template-driven forms are defined using HTML templates and Angular directives. Reactive forms are defined in the component class and offer more control over validation and form handling.

### 22. **How do you create an Angular service?**
   **Answer:** You can create a service using the Angular CLI command: `ng generate service myService`. This generates a service file where you can define methods and logic that can be shared across components.

### 23. **What is a guard in Angular?**
   **Answer:** A guard is an interface that can be used to control access to routes in Angular. Common types of guards are `CanActivate`, `CanActivateChild`, `CanDeactivate`, and `Resolve`.

### 24. **What is Angular’s Change Detection?**
   **Answer:** Change detection is the process of checking the state of model data and updating the DOM when it changes. Angular uses a change detection mechanism to update the view automatically.

### 25. **What are Angular Forms Validators?**
   **Answer:** Validators in Angular are used to enforce rules and constraints on form inputs. Built-in validators include `required`, `minlength`, `maxlength`, `pattern`, and custom validators can also be created.

### 26. **What is Lazy Loading in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Lazy loading is a design pattern where modules are loaded only when needed, reducing the initial loading time of the application. It can be configured using the `loadChildren` property in Angular routing.

### 27. **What is AOT Compilation in Angular?**
   **Answer:** AOT (Ahead-of-Time) compilation is the process of compiling the Angular application at build time. It helps improve the application’s performance by reducing the size of the JavaScript bundles.

### 28. **What is JIT Compilation in Angular?**
   **Answer:** JIT (Just-in-Time) compilation compiles the Angular application in the browser at runtime. It is slower compared to AOT but is useful during development for faster iterations.

### 29. **What is the purpose of `ng-content` in Angular?**
   **Answer:** `ng-content` is used for content projection in Angular. It allows you to project content from a parent component into a child component’s template.

### 30. **What is a Singleton service in Angular?**
   **Answer:** A singleton service is a service that is instantiated once and shared across all components that inject it. This can be achieved using Angular's DI system by providing the service at the root level.

### 31. **What is `ngZone` in Angular?**
   **Answer:** `ngZone` is used for managing the execution context in Angular. It helps trigger change detection and ensures that the Angular framework updates the UI when asynchronous tasks are completed.

### 32. **What is `ngModule` in Angular?**
   **Answer:** `NgModule` is a decorator that defines an Angular module. It organizes related components, services, and pipes into a cohesive block of code.

### 33. **What is the purpose of `@Input()` and `@Output()` in Angular?**
   **Answer:** `@Input()` is used to pass data from a parent component to a child component, and `@Output()` is used to emit events from a child component to the parent component.

### 34. **What are Angular Pipes?**
   **Answer:** Pipes transform data in Angular templates. Built-in pipes include `DatePipe`, `CurrencyPipe`, `UpperCasePipe`, etc., and custom pipes can be created to modify data as needed.

### 35. **What is the use of `trackBy` in `ngFor`?**
   **Answer:** `trackBy` is used in `ngFor` to optimize performance by helping Angular track the items being iterated over, especially when the list changes dynamically.

### 36. **What are Observables in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Observables represent data streams that can emit values over time. In Angular, observables are used for asynchronous operations like HTTP requests and events.

### 

37. **What is an HTTP Interceptor in Angular?**
   **Answer:** HTTP interceptors allow you to intercept and modify HTTP requests or responses. They are commonly used for logging, authentication, or modifying headers.

### 38. **What are the common ways to share data between components in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Data can be shared between components using:
   - **Input/Output decorators** for parent-child communication.
   - **Services** for cross-component communication.
   - **RxJS Subjects/Observables** for communication between non-related components.

### 39. **How does Angular handle errors?**
   **Answer:** Angular handles errors using:
   - **ErrorHandler** class for global error handling.
   - `try-catch` blocks and custom error handling in services.

### 40. **What is the purpose of Angular's `ngOnChanges()` lifecycle hook?**
   **Answer:** `ngOnChanges()` is called whenever there is a change in the input properties of a component. It receives an object that holds the previous and current values of input properties.

### 41. **What are Event Emitters in Angular?**
   **Answer:** `EventEmitter` is a class used to send events from a child component to a parent component.

### 42. **What is the purpose of `zone.js` in Angular?**
   **Answer:** `zone.js` is a library that enables Angular’s change detection mechanism to automatically detect changes when asynchronous operations (e.g., HTTP requests, timers) complete.

### 43. **What is the difference between `ngOnInit` and `constructor` in Angular components?**
   **Answer:** The `constructor` is used for dependency injection and setting up component-level properties. `ngOnInit` is used for initialization logic after Angular has fully initialized the component’s inputs.

### 44. **How do you handle form validation in Angular?**
   **Answer:** Form validation in Angular can be done using both built-in and custom validators. You can define validators in reactive forms or use directives like `required`, `minlength`, etc., in template-driven forms.

### 45. **What are Angular Animations?**
   **Answer:** Angular Animations provide a framework for adding complex animations to Angular applications. It uses the `@angular/animations` module and allows you to create animations using triggers and state transitions.

### 46. **What is Angular's `$event` object?**
   **Answer:** `$event` is an object that is automatically passed to event handlers in Angular. It contains information about the event (like event type, target, etc.).

### 47. **What is a constructor in an Angular component?**
   **Answer:** The constructor is a method in a class that is called when the class is instantiated. In Angular components, the constructor is typically used to inject services and set initial property values.

### 48. **What is the purpose of `ngAfterContentInit`?**
   **Answer:** `ngAfterContentInit` is called after Angular has initialized content projected into the component via `ng-content`.

### 49. **How do you implement a custom pipe in Angular?**
   **Answer:** A custom pipe is implemented by creating a class with the `Pipe` decorator. The class should implement the `PipeTransform` interface and provide a `transform` method to define the logic for transforming data.

### 50. **What are Angular's `Renderer2` and why would you use it?**
   **Answer:** `Renderer2` is a service that allows you to safely manipulate the DOM in a way that works across all platforms (including web workers and server-side rendering). It helps in avoiding direct manipulation of the DOM, ensuring better cross-platform compatibility.
