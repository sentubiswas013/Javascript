Tips for Interview Preparation:

Understand the fundamentals: Have a strong grasp of basic JavaScript concepts like scoping, closures, and prototypal inheritance.

Practice coding: Use platforms like LeetCode, HackerRank, Codewars, and Exercism to practice solving problems.

Know the latest features: Make sure you’re familiar with ES6+ features like arrow functions, destructuring, async/await, and promises.

Solve problems in different ways: Many problems can be solved in multiple ways—make sure you can articulate time and space complexity and justify your approach.
